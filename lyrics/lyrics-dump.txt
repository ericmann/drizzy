J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle". I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.

Je sais que tu dois être un thug pour elle Ce n’est pas ce qu’elle a voulu dire lorsqu’elle t’a dit de plus l'ouvrir Ouais, tes doigts sur les détentes se transforment en doigts qui tapent sur ton clavier Twitter Tu te fais enterrer par un négro qui chante Je ne suis pas le genre de négro qui irait écrire sur le clavier aux négros Dédicace à toutes ces patronnes qui entretiennent leurs négros comme si ils étaient leurs femmes Faites en sortes de faire un accord prénuptial Ensuite dites à votre mec de se calmer J’en ai fait un autre, j’en ai fait un autre Tu n’as toujours rien fait au sujet de l’autre Je continue à boire des verres l’un après l’autre Ouais, l’un après l’autre Je continue à boire des verres l’un après l’autre Ouais, l’un après l’autre Je ne veux plus jamais en entendre parler Même quand elle me diras c'est mieux s'ils restent amis Même quand tu diras "Drizzy, dis leur encore" J’ai fait un concert ca a été un événement soldout Ohh, tu ferais mieux de t'asseoir Je ne voulais pas le faire, c'est toi qui l'a cherché Ce que j’essaie de dire c’est que je n'ai jamais eu besoins d'eux Tu ferais n'importe quoi pour la célébrité ou ta liberté S’il te plait, vérifie si il n’est pas sur écoute S’il te plait, s’il te plait ne laisses pas ces négros m'approcher S’il te plait, réfléchis avant de t’attaquer au meilleur S’il te plait, qui est un vrai négro et qui n’en est pas un ? S’il te plait, que quelqu’un m’arrête Je parle comme un gangster confiant J’ai le festival dans cinq jours et c’est le mien Dès que je vais monter sur scènes ils vont me demander si je peux refaire ce son Ouais, ils les veulent l’un après l’autre Ils vont me demander si je peux refaire ce morceau J’ai fait une pause avec mon album Views, maintenant je suis de retour sur ça négro

Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal I wouldn't have it any other way (2x) Verse 2: Kyoko Baby just because I wanna look good Don't mean that I ain't real Not in the least bit All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails Make me feel good And I'll keep it up Im not sayin what you been stayin to me Ain't exactly What I need to feel and know You're the one I'm wearing for And where I'll always go when I need a real love Kyoko Chorus: So stay real What you make me feel Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal And I don't want it any other way (2x)

[Drake talking] Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man The whole up North A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter But listen [Verse 1: Drake] I met this new girl late June or early July I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?" It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy See that was a segue, I believe the matter Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing And if you planning family vacations you better know when But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties! [Drake talking] Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one But just wait, nah mean, take it slow [Verse 2: Drake] Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat" Off this I'm kinda takin it back for a second I get her number she tells me to call her after this session And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho! [Drake talking] Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right Uh, ya man, it's what it is [Verse 3: Drake] And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town And stupid me I just listen to her Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed When we were together it seeming like way back when Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime [Bridge (Drake talking)] I miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out] (give me a second to gather my thoughts) [Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!) And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man) (Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?) Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing (I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss) (Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby) [Verse 4: Drake] I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup So we can get back to them cognac nights With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild The winter came and blew his cold air through Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her By the end of the week I would know that crew And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen But this Summer is different it's a two man operation Granted the fact that we one man short Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' The face, the breast, the bras, the toes I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside We'll never talk again, scary and true That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit And when they talk about they past and lovers And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive [Voice] Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
That shit was wack as fuck I was like, 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better — make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won? This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!

[Verse 1] When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting And it's all because she don't want things to change [Hook] So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you That's the wrong thing to do Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you That's the wrong thing to do Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you That's the wrong thing to do Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying And say I love you, too [Bridge] But I need someone different You know it, oh ho, you know it Oh ho, you know it, we both know it I need someone different You know it, oh ho, you know it Oh ho, you know it, we both know it Something's been missing You know it, oh ho, she knows it Oh ho, I know it, we all know it I need someone different (Oh ho, oh ho) [Verse 2] We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together But we sure make it feel like we're together Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else [Hook] [Bridge] [Outro - Stevie Wonder Harmonica]

Connor Shell: You’re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility? Drake: Yeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I’ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he’s in. I don’t think that there’s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it’s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation. I’m just honored to know him and glad that I’ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it’s an incredible thing. I actually woke up kind of late today, so I’m just catching on. It’s a great feeling for me. I can’t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he’s been a friend of mine for a long time. Shell: Obviously, you’ve joined Saturday Night Live and we’ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we’ve seen in the past? Drake: I think obviously one of the talents that I’m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I’m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I’m not there to put on a strictly music‑based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre‑tapes. Yeah, I think it’s just going to be a great night overall. I’m there to deliver a great hosting job. Shell: What makes the perfect ESPYS host? We’ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer? Drake: Well, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I’m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don’t know. To me, it’s just about knowing the room that you’re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve. Shell: Hosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music’s role in sports? Drake: Well I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they’re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I’ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they’re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that’s what really ties music and sports together. Shell: This is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow‑up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close? Maura Mandt: No, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn’t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that’s what you look for the host for. We’re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we’ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don’t try to make that news happen. It unfolds. Shell: Drake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip‑hop that’s kind of also a part of rap music and it’s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip‑hop? Drake: I think that’s a funny question. I think it’s a good fit. I definitely think that hip‑hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we’re not trying to end people’s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that’s kind of most of the time what problems in hip‑hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports. So, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different. Shell: You’re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don’t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she’ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you’ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you’ll be hosting the ESPYS? Drake: Well, I obviously don’t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I’m not sure she’ll be able to make it, but I’m sure I’ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I’m sure, if I haven’t done it already, now that I know you’re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know. Shell: One of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build‑up. Today, I don’t know if you realize this, but you’ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means? Drake: Well, as far as the latter end of the question, I’d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That’s why I’m excited. We’ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre‑tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will. Shell: Is Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment? Drake: First of all, I’d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I’ve been ‑‑ in the past, I’ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it’s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams. So it’s not that I’m team jumping, I’m just a supportive friend. With the recent news, of course I’m going to go ‑‑ of course I’m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we’ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother. So I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best. But, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I’ve been time and time again touring, I just think it’s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they’re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I’m really excited. Shell: So the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you’re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you’re a bachelor again. Drake: Well, actually, my status hasn’t changed, just to clear that up. I’ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don’t let my focus stray. So for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don’t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be ‑‑ to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it’s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don’t know if it’s a real thing or not, but it’s very real and it’s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I’ll figure out the next steps for me. I’m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we’ll figure out what’s next afterwards. Shell: One thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you’re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne. With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show? Drake: Yeah, I’m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they’re good. I’m excited. They’re great. Shell: Are you bringing your lint roller? Drake: Oh, yes. I think I’ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn’t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I’ll be lint‑free that night. I’ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit. Shell: So we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they’re going to wear? Drake: I’m not exactly sure what brands I’m going to be wearing. Right now I’m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I’ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I’ll be wearing. But I’m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I’ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that’s really what my main focus is, but I’ll get my suits together. I’m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won’t have to say anything. Shell: You have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven’t met yet that you’re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you’re with already given you any advice about hosting? Drake: Well, I mean, I’ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I’m looking forward to meeting? I mean, yeah, I was going to say, I’ve never met Skylar. I’m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won’t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It’s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I’d like to meet. Just for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn’t win, so that’s how he’s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is. Shell: Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song? Drake: Oh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that’s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We’ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I’m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre‑taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it. Is writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it’s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it. But, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it’s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you’re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do. Mandt: I’d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it’s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we’ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what’s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it’s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved. We had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I’m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I’m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.

[Intro] This is why I do this shit I think they call this, venting [Verse 1] Look, this is me, still the same They want the hits, I play the game No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville? I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal That ain't how it works, that ain't that how it goes And I been getting high just to balance out the lows And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows And every time I try, it opens up my eyes These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive So every word I utter will be mine [Hook] Dont believe the lies, look me in my eyes Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me I remember you, this feeling isn't new So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me [Verse 2] (Don't take this the wrong way but, uh) I never cried when Pac died But I probably will when Hov does And if my tears hold value then I would drop one For every single thing he showed us And I'll be standing in a puddle I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble And I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle Staring at the members of my team Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions At least I put it all in the open [Hook] [Verse 3] Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here I should be on top of the world just chilling here But it's funny having fans Who find you before anybody ever has the chance And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown And now security follow me everywhere So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone I think I'm scared of what the future holds I was wishing for some things and now am used to those Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes The honesty of my music has left me too exposed All my old friends think I got a new crowd And people seem to notice every time I do smile I guess that mean they come few and far between Even know I'm living out what you would call the dream And my uncle ain't even messaging me And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me I hope this isn't one of those forever things It's funny how money can change everything [Hook]
[Verse 1] I'm more than just an option Refuse to be forgotten I took a chance with my heart And I feel it taking over [Hook] I better find your loving, I better find your heart I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart [Verse 2] I'm more than just a number I doubt you'll find another So every single summer I'll be the one that you'll remember [Hook] [Verse 3] It's more than just a mission You hear, but you don't listen You better pay attention And get what you've been missing [Hook] [Bridge] Too many times I've been wrong I guess being right takes too long I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do But give all I have to you and [Hook]

Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that, cause... [Hook: Jhene Aiko] I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love [Verse 1: Drake] I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the 70's on your own My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? [Hook] [Verse 2: Drake] Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it Cause that night I played her three songs Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? [Hook] [Outro: Baka] "Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G, been have up di ting dem from time, G. So I don't know what's wrong with these little wasteman out here eh? Y'all need to know yourself."

Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need uh,uh, uh, uh to educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot (Yeah, you’re right. You’re right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…) They know they’re too hot. They don’t give a fuck. It’s the Heat Of The Moment. It’s the Heat Of The Moment and that’s all it is. It’s The Heat Of The Moment (I agree.) This shit, that’s all it is. It’s the heat of the moment.

Look I would have so many friends if I didn't have money, success, and accomplishments I would have so many friends if I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit Man, I would have so many more friends if I lost my respect and my confidence Cause I'm in the club every time that they play the competition If they even play the competition, and I see no response they get Nobody's even hearing it, on top of the pyramid Might go to Detroit and disappear again My circle got so small that its a period saying to myself Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit All I, all I, all I, ever ask is that you keep it 100 Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit Your better off realizing there's nothing you can do with me All I ever ask is you keep it 8 more than 92 with me... 100
[Driver] How was your night pop? [Drake] It was, uh... it was alright. Shit's just crazy man. The whole energy out here is just changing, you know, it's just getting dark man, quick. It's like mans are on the road it feels like as if anybody is a target, you know, you just don't know where it's gonna come from, can't even gauge it man. It's like I go from that, trying to balance that to just balance my own sanity, drinking more, smoking more, you know staying up so late that it's early, like fuck. I'm not losing it though, you know, I'm just venting, I'm not like worried, it's already too late for these guys trust me, I'm just more worried about myself you know, I just gotta come home. JUNGLE ??: What's the day today? ??: October 2nd, 2008 ??: I'mma take the same video, on October 2nd 2009 and see if we can get in this thing without ID (?)

I remember when you thought I was joking Now I'm off singing karaoke Further than I've ever been So if you gotta go If there's any way I can help [Verse 3: Drake] Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner And tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta Damn, of all the places you could go I just thought you'd choose somewhere that had somebody that you know I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron I hope that you don't get known for nothing crazy Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady I know they say the first love is the sweetest But that first cut is the deepest I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets Secrets you were telling everybody but me Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky I'm surprised you couldn't tell [Hook] I was only trying to get ahead I was only trying to get ahead But the spotlight makes you nervous And you're looking for a purpose

Drake has confirmed the title of his upcoming fourth studio album, Views From the 6, though he won't begin work on it until after he returns from his 31-city co-headlining tour with Lil Wayne. The tour, slated to start after the Canadian rapper's OVO Fest, will kick off August 8th in Darien Center, New York and run through September 27th, when it ends in Woodlands, Texas. That tour, which is sponsored by a video-game manufacturer, will feature a nightly competition between fans of the two rappers. The meaning of the album title is unclear, but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper. On July 16th, Drake will host ESPN's ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music, comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes. Later in the month, Drake's label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd, and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th. Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artist's "Recognize," streaming below via Rap-Up, which will appear on the album. Drake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th, when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set, with appearances by yet-to-be-confirmed special guests. This year, OVO Fest was awarded a CAN $300,000 government grant, which amounts to roughly US $268,000, as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fest's 35,000 tickets.
